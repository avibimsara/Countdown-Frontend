# Countdown-Frontend

This is the Front-end of the countdown app.

## Description

Following is a brief description of the functionality of the app.

1. Landing Page: The app opens with a responsive landing page that welcomes users and provides a clear call-to-action button to navigate to the inner page.

2. Inner Page: Upon clicking the button, users are taken to the inner page, where the countdown timer is displayed.

3. Countdown Timer: The inner page displays a countdown timer, and the timer's duration is set dynamically from the backend server. The countdown timer is updated in real-time, showing the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

4. Server Connection: The app communicates with a backend server using RESTful API endpoints. It fetches the countdown parameter from the server, enabling users to see a dynamically updated countdown.

5. Push Notification: When the countdown reaches zero, a push notification is sent to the user's device, showing the message "Time over" in the notification bar.

Overall, the app provides users with a straightforward and user-friendly countdown timer experience with the added convenience of dynamic countdown duration and timely push notifications.
